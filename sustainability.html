			<span data-icon="update" data-index="4" data-status="inactive">It's not getting better though, we are expected to gain over <b>82 million tons</b> by 2030.</span>

			<span data-icon="local_shipping" data-index="6" data-status="inactive">But where do we get all our products from? Over <b>9 million tons</b> of silicon were mined in 2023, higher from two years before.</span>
			<span data-icon="precision_manufacturing" data-index="7" data-status="inactive">Out of all of that, about <b>40%</b> of silicon is actually used - the rest are thrown out.</span>

			<div class="step">
				<div class="stepNumber one">1</div>
				<div class="stepDetails">
					<div class="stepTitle">SmartExchange Program: Exchange "Junk" for Cash!</div>
					<div class="stepDescription">Recently, we began a program where you could exchange your old products, whether it was a smartphone from the 2010s to a pair of glassses you no longer use, we provided a monetary value to exchange back to you as a way of us saying "thank you!" Over the course of a couple months from this program as a test, we have been able to recieve <b>200</b> products in exchange for over <b title="no we didn't actually do this" class="disclaimer">$5,329</b> back! In fact, we plan to start the same process with other fellow manufacturing centers to hopefully gain more reusable parts as well!</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="step">
				<div class="stepNumber one">2</div>
				<div class="stepDetails">
					<div class="stepTitle">Green from Us, Green for All!</div>
					<div class="stepDescription">If we want to be responsible with how we produce our products, it is a good idea to produce them sustainably and efficiently, wouldnt it? We have kept our promise, and we still do, that over <b>15% of our sales</b> will be returend to funding renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines. In fact, we have been able to convert nearly 20% of our factories to renewable sources over the past couple years.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="step">
				<div class="stepNumber one">3</div>
				<div class="stepDetails">
					<div class="stepTitle">Maximize our Commodities!</div>
					<div class="stepDescription">Every resource we gain and use is valuable, and we believe from our roots that none should ever go to waste. Take a look at our <a href="img/CommodityChain.png">commodity chain</a> for the Smart Glasses, as well as our <a href="img/ManufacturingSites.png">manufacturing sites</a> for our four fundamental sources!</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="step">
				<div class="stepNumber one">4</div>
				<div class="stepDetails">
					<div class="stepTitle">Minimize Delays, Minimize Storage, Minimize Needs, Minimize everything!</div>
					<div class="stepDescription">To have responsible and reasonable consumption, everything that comes in MUST come out to everyone, and almost nothing should be left over and left in storage rooms. We operate under a just-in-time manufacturing (JIT) schedule, and many of our manufacturing sectors are willing to export everything and anything to those who seek to our prdoucts.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="step">
				<div class="stepNumber one">5</div>
				<div class="stepDetails">
					<div class="stepTitle">Collaborating with Development!</div>
					<div class="stepDescription">We aren't trying to avoid periphery countries, and we believe that to be responsible in consumption and production is to also allow everyone equal access to our products. We believe that Smart Glasses can help country development and bridge economic and social gaps within developing countries, which is why we are also <b>working with non-governmental organizations (NGOs)</b> and come up with ways to distribute our product for everyone!</div>
